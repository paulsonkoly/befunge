This project was an interesting experiment in TDD. Around d5f12d9f4670f72f70d902882a0b635bbd12066c I've reached full module level coverage. Yet by adding more and more integration examples new bugs were discovered. Mainly missing wiring between modules and some mis-specced module level behaviour. 100% module level coverage means NOTHING.
